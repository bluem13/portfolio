            <div class="container"><div id = "content-to-adjust"><p1 id="aboutText">I grew up in a small city in rural Wisconsin where cows outnumbered people five to one. I am the youngest of five and the only boy in my family. Throughout my early years and into high school, 
                I participated in sports like football, basketball and track. I also participated in band playing the euphonium and was an awarded as an exemplary soloist at state solo ensemble. Post secondary, I 
                spent my first two years of college studying music before discovering I did not want to pursue a degree in music anymore. Instead, I joined the work force and continued to hone in on my IT skills gained through 
                classes I've took in the past and personal curiousity. I grew a passion for IT & Networking around the age of 12 when I wanted to host a Minecraft server and have been interested in the field ever since. Since then, I have learned IT skills through apprenticeships, 
                mentorships and internships. I have seven years of mixed experience with working on-site as an internet technician, tertiary endpoint support at a university, and entry level support at a university. 
             <br> <br><strong> Update:</strong> I am currently a senior at UWGB studying Information Technology & Data Science with an emphasis
                in Information Technology. Upon graduating, my plans post graduating is to work for a county, university, or in a highschool.
